# Short Summary
This is a repository dedicated to the "3D Comic" that I built for a school exhibition. It contains multiple scenes with a sample character that can be moved around to your desired position, then you can change its pose. Then you can position the camera and get a screenshot to put in a comic.

# Disclaimer
I wrote this code when I was 14, and It wasn't made with open source in mind, so don't expect a clean project!
